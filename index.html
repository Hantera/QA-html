<h2>Do you consider yourself more of a designer or developer (or something else, other answers are acceptable)?</h2>
<p>I consider myself a developer since I am more interested at making the sites that I am creating at to work.</p>
<h2>What are you most interested in learning in this class?</h2>
<p>I hope to learn how to make good designs and whatever else that is needed to learn about in this class</p>
<h2>What is good design?</h2>
<p>A good design has a good amount of stuff in the design without looking too weird</p>
<h2>What is good web design?</h2>
<p>Any site that has good information and not so many advertisements is a good web design.</p>
<h2>What are the good examples of conference/event web sites? Answer by listing at least two sites including each URL 
and why you chose the site.</h2>
<p>These sites are good web designs because they show information and news that the people who the site want to know about.
